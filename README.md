Ransomware Vaccine is a C++ program that continuously monitors system processes every 0.25 seconds, detecting and terminating any cmd.exe or powershell.exe instances running forbidden commands like shadow copy deletion. It also closes the parent process, disconnects the internet, deletes startup folders, and shuts down the system to prevent potential ransomware threats.
